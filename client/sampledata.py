The results show that the deeper 34-layer plain net has higher validation error than the shallower 18-layer plain net. The training/validation errors are compared in Fig.\xa04 (left) and the degradation problem is observed, where the 34-layer plain net has higher training error throughout the whole training procedure. It is argued that this optimization difficulty is unlikely to be caused by vanishing gradients. The 34-layer plain net is still able to achieve competitive accuracy, suggesting that the solver works to some extent.',

The baseline architectures are the same as the above plain nets, except that a shortcut connection is added to each pair of 3×\\times×3 filters as in Fig.\xa03 (right). Identity mapping is used for all shortcuts and zero-padding is used for increasing dimensions (option A). The situation is reversed with residual learning – the 34-layer ResNet is better than the 18-layer ResNet (by 2.8%). The 34-layer ResNet exhibits considerably lower training error and is generalizable to the validation data, indicating that the degradation problem is well addressed in this setting. Compared to its plain counterpart, the 34-layer ResNet reduces the top-1 error by 3.5%. The 18-layer plain/residual nets are comparably accurate, but the 18-layer ResNet converges faster.'},
